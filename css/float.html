Developmental language disorder (DLD) is identified when a child has problems with language development that continue into school age and beyond.
 The language problems have a significant impact on everyday social interactions or educational progress, and occur in the absence of autism spectrum 
 disorder, intellectual disability or a known biomedical condition. The most obvious problems are difficulties in using words and sentences to express
 meanings, but for many children, understanding of language (receptive language) is also a challenge, although this may not be evident unless the child
 is given a formal assessment.
